## About

The **Autonoma Bank Demo** is a showcase application that mimics a real-world banking experience — complete with dashboards, transactions, and account management screens.

This demo is designed to be used with **[Autonoma AI](https://getautonoma.com)** to automatically **generate, execute, and maintain end-to-end tests** across both web and mobile environments. It provides realistic user flows for testing login, payments, transfers, and UI consistency, serving as a sandbox to demonstrate Autonoma’s no-code AI testing capabilities.

And yes — it was **vibe-coded proudly with [v0](https://v0.dev)**.
